pawon-search is the software for efficiently finding words that are formed
[lipogrammatically][lipogram] (by combining only a few different letters),
for &#x1B06B;&#x1B052;&#x1B11E;&#x1B088;&#x1B01A;&#x1B066;.

&#x1B06B;&#x1B052;&#x1B11E;&#x1B088;&#x1B01A;&#x1B066; (the proper reading is
"TU-SE-N(or MU, MO)-NI-KA-TI", spelled in modern kana as "つせんにかち", but
contemporary Japanese who are unfamiliar with hentaigana (obsolete hiragana)
might recognize the glyphs as **"HA(or PA)-WO-N-KO-U-TI"**) is the game
inspired by [NKODICE], to enjoy the fun of random word formed by rolling dice.
